            <p>The effort required to learn new information is often intense and involves study practices that are minimally effective. Students may spend hours using suboptimal learning strategies. Learning is important for everyone, not just students. If a behavior or thought isn’t innate, then it is dependent on learning and memory. Most of our behaviors are learned. In the context of this article, think of learning and memory as being connected—or you can think of learning as a relatively permanent change in thinking or behavior due to experience. This process of learning is a process of forming new memories.    

                Memory reflects the ability to acquire, store, and retrieve information. This information may be as simple as the routine details needed for everyday living and as complex as the abstract knowledge required for mathematics and science. Memory provides a coherent picture of the past and allows us to put current experiences into perspective. Memory influences thinking about the future because these thoughts are often based on what we experienced in the past. Most of your thoughts and actions are dependent to some degree on memory.  </p>
